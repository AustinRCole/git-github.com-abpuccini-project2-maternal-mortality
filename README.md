# Maternal-Mortality-Rates

Project Overview:


For this projec, we developed an interactive dashboard for users to explore maternal mortality data globally and within the United States. Users will be able to visualize maternal mortality data alongside data for potentially related factors, such as access to health insurance and Medicaid.
Weâ€™re focusing on factors at the state level because maternal mortality rates and healthcare policies and access vary widely between states.
