                <hr>
                <p>The five states with the highest maternal mortality rates as of the 2019 America's Healthcare Rankings Health of Women and Children (HWC) report were Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, and Arkansas. Conversely, the five states with the lowest rates were Alaska, Massachusets, Nevada, Delaware, and West Virginia. Here you can visualize the maternal mortality rates for those states alongside their national rankings for potentially related factors.</p>
                <p>Use the dropdown menu to choose a ranked measure to compare with the maternal mortality rates for the selected states. We chose to visualize measures from the 2019 HWC Report that we thought might show interesting correlations.</p>
                <p>Aside from Maternal Mortality Rate, all measures are displayed by their ranking: "The state health rankings are a composite index of state-level population health measures. Each measure is ranked by the states’ values, with one being the healthiest value and 50 the least healthy value. Ties in value are assigned equal ranks." <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/about/methodology/rankings" target="_blank"><em>United Health Foundation</em></a></p>

            <hr>
            <div id="conclusions">
                <p>For some of the measures we have visualized, larger numbers were a positive thing, while for others, smaller numbers were a positive thing (see measure notes below). Therefor what we were hoping to accomplish with these visualizations is simply establishing if there appear to be any correlations or trends warranting further investigation.</p>
                <p>For some measures, there are not any clear trends we could discern, but for others there was clumping, wherein the high MMR states and low MMR states were grouped more closely with themselves. More in-depth data gathering and analysis would be necessary to draw any significant conclusions, but we are able to conclude that there are likely some connections between MMR and the other health measures we are looking at here.</p>
                <p>For some measures, like Health Outcomes - Women, we were surprised to see that the states with higher MMR actually trended as lower ranked overall. This leads us to believe that there are likely other factors at play that are not obvious within this limited dataset</p>
